# SC1015 Data Science & AI Mini Project - Diabetes Health Indicators

## Project Overview

This repository contains the machine learning project developed by students from Nanyang Technological University for the SC1015 - Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence course. The project aims to predict the risk of diabetes using demographic, lifestyle, and health indicator data. The dataset is sourced from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and is available on Kaggle.

## Team Members

- Dong Zhijian
- Muhammad Faqih Akmal
- Lim Zhen Rong

## Motivation

With an expected rise in diabetes cases to 1.31 billion by 2050, early and effective diabetes detection is crucial. This project develops a machine learning model to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, facilitating early interventions.

## Data Source

The data used can be found here: [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset)
